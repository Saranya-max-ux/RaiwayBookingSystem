 # RailwayBookingSystem 🚂
Overview
This project details the architecture and design of a comprehensive railway reservation platform. It is engineered to handle various aspects of ticket management, including booking 🎟️, cancellation ❌, and real-time seat allocation 💺, with a strong emphasis on robust object-oriented design principles.

Key Features
=> Comprehensive Reservation Platform: Supports end-to-end railway ticket booking and cancellation processes. ✅

=> Real-time Seat Management: Implements a system for dynamic allocation and deallocation of seats, ensuring up-to-date availability. 🔄

=> Object-Oriented Design (OOD): Developed with a focus on OOD principles to ensure high code modularity and maintainability. 🧩

=> Automated Ticket Reallocation: Features an intelligent system for reallocating cancelled tickets. 🤖

=> Priority-based Reallocation: Prioritizes special categories during ticket reallocation, specifically benefiting seniors 👴👵 and women with children 👩‍👧‍👦.

# Architecture Highlights

=> The system is designed with a layered architecture, separating concerns to enhance scalability and maintainability. Key components include:

=> User Interface Layer: Handles user interactions and displays reservation information. 💻

=> Business Logic Layer: Contains the core reservation, cancellation, and seat management algorithms. 🧠

=> Data Access Layer: Manages interactions with the underlying database for persistent storage of booking and seat data. 💾

# Design Principles

=> Modularity: Breaking down the system into independent, interchangeable modules. 🧱

=> Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit. 🔒

=> Inheritance: Allowing new classes to inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes. 🔗

=> Polymorphism: Enabling objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type. 🎭
